# 🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **Breast Cancer (Benign or Malignant)** using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used is from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, and the primary goal is to identify the most accurate model to assist in early detection.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Applied
- 📊 **Decision Tree (DT)**
- 🔄 **Logistic Regression (LG)**
- ⚙️ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** ✅ **(Best Accuracy: 97%)**
- 📉 **Naive Bayes (NB)**
- 🌳 **Random Forest (RF)**

Among all models, **SVM** achieved the highest accuracy of **97%**, making it the most effective for this prediction task.
